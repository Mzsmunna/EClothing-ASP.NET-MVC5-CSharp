# EClothing
It's the same old Project  I build on Laravel as well as node.js. This time I build this with ASP.NET MVC5 using C#. But once again this doesn't hold the all promising features developed in laravel. This contains basic Ecommerce website feature where customer can search &amp; buy clothes. And Admin can add, update, delete product.

MVC5 has been used in this Project. And Code First approach has been followed while building the Poject.

ORM pattern has been followed as well. There has been used Entity Framework along with LINQ.
